            <p class="mb-0 person-bio">I’m a high school environmental science educator, happy to once again be based in Wichita, KS. I’ve worn a lot of hats in a lot of different places on my search for personally meaningful and globally responsible work. Among them: farmer, biologist, builder, cook, conservationist, and now, teacher. Through all these, I’ve seen some inspiring efforts towards environmentally-centered community building—something that I believe we have a lot of untapped—and uncelebrated—potential for. My intention through Tilth is to promote and sustain efforts in areas like urban environmental resilience, food access/sovereignty, and climate readiness. I’m a reader (Wanna start a book club?), outdoorsy (Wanna take a hike?), a home cook (What’s your best recipe?), and an amateur craftsman (Wanna build something?)</p>

              , and had a hard time writing a bio that doesn’t read like a bad dating profile. I’m a snake mom and nature nerd
              , an aesthete and collector of oddities. I love a good 70’s look, but you can usually find me running around in yoga pants and a band tee.
               My day job consists of organizing and event planning. I keep busy in my free time volunteering with the Wichita tenant union Renters Together ICT,
              playing DnD and going on nature adventures with my friends, and dabbling in various crafts and art forms. I have music or a podcast on in the background
               at all times, so send me your recommendations! I’m a little chaotic and a bit dark, but with an edge of optimism, and always down to talk about mental
               health or the state of the world. I’m most passionate about supporting my friends and my community. Love & solidarity.</p>

As a Renaissance Woman, I have varied skills, including accounting, mechanic-ing, silversmithing, drawing, and event planning. I am always ready to share about my favorite camping spot, my corgis and their antics, my house plants, and anything else that has piqued my interest that day.</p>

I can typically be found sipping cocktails or at my computer playing games (of which I have way too many to actually finish any at this point). My local ambition is simply wanting to be more plugged into the local community and to see the Arts and Culture of Wichita thrive.</p>

Outside of that, I’m a pop culture snob and a collector. Collecting pop culture art, board games, action figures, and 1,100+ vinyl records. Come talk to me all day about films and music, I’m your guy.
